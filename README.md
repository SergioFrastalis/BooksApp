This project is split into three parts.

BooksWebApp.Core has the core stuff like the Book and Review classes, and the interfaces for the repositories.

BooksWebApp.Infrastructure is where the database logic is. It connects the app to the database using Entity Framework.

BooksWebApp.Web is the main app. It has the pages, the controllers, and handles user login and the UI.

They all work together as one solution. You just open the solution file and everything should be ready to go.

The project uses MVC architecture

Entities: ( Book, Review, ReviewVote, ApplicationUser)
Interfaces : Repo interfaces

- Async/await is used throughout
